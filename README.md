# ShortStorySuggestions
Ruby script that recommends short stories from r/writingprompts. Requires ElasticSearch.

Expects ElasticSearch to be running on port 9200, and the mapping to have been precreated.

Saves a record of the bulk import it does in case something goes wrong.

Built for CS410 Text Information Systems at UIUC.
